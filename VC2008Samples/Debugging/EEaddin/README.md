## About this sample

This sample shows how to create an EEAddin for the legacy native debugger (the debugger that shipped with Visual Studio 2002 through Visual Studio 2010).

## This sample today

The recomended way to run custom code to format types is by implementing IDkmCustomVisualizer. You can find a sample for this in the [ConcordExtensibility repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/wiki/Cpp-Custom-Visualizer-Sample).

Legacy EE Addins can still be used with Visual Studio's current debugger. But as of Visual Studio 2019 they will no longer work with Visual Studio in the default configuartion.
